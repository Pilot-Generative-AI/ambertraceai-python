"""61 -- Macro regime: proof-carrying growth x inflation quadrant classification.

The macro cycle in one map: real GDP growth momentum against its recent trend on
one axis, CPI inflation momentum against its recent trend on the other, giving
four mutually-exclusive quadrants -- REFLATION, GOLDILOCKS, STAGFLATION,
DEFLATION (the investment-clock regimes).

This demo writes those four definitions in *plain English*, lets the platform
induce the ontology, builds a **verified** platform, and classifies conditions
so every regime call carries a machine-checked proof (``proof_checked``).

Unlike a black-box regime model, each answer names the symbolic rules that fired
and ships a proof certificate -- and the four cells are a *symmetric N-class*
verdict, so no regime is a silent "everything else" default.

WHICH API -- this uses the ordinary ``domains`` -> ``build_ontology`` ->
``platforms`` surface (the same shape as ``38_symmetric_multiclass_classifier``).
There is no new SDK method -- the classifier IS the domain platform. Query it
with ``platforms.query(...)`` and read ``report["decision"]`` (the winning
label) and ``report["proof_checked"]``.

DATA: momentum features (growth / inflation measured against their multi-year
trend) derived from public-domain FRED series (real GDP ``GDPC1``, CPI
``CPIAUCSL``); bundled as ``data/macro_regime_momentum.csv``. No API key beyond
AmberTrace is needed.

    python 61_macro_regime.py                    # build + classify the 4 quadrants
    python 61_macro_regime.py --standard         # skip the verified profile
    python 61_macro_regime.py --platform-id 42   # reuse an already-built platform
