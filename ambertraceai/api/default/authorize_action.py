    r"""Authorize an agent tool-call against the verified policy

     Proof-carrying gate. Maps the action's args + context to the certified facts the policy reasons
    over, returning a certified permit/deny verdict with its machine-checked proof. Fail-closed: a
    rejected fact, proof-check failure, or unavailable engine yields no permit.

    The verdict carries an `outcome` field: `permit` (proven within policy), `deny` (a restrictive
    verdict fired on the supplied facts), `indeterminate` (a REQUIRED input was missing/underivable —
    fail-closed, NOT a denial; the remedy is to supply the named field), and `unavailable` (the verified
    reasoning engine is temporarily down). For `indeterminate` the verdict also carries `missing_inputs`
    (the declared field name(s) the chain needed but were neither supplied nor derived),
    `stalled_stage`, and a `query_diagnostics` block (identical shape to the query route:
    `missing_atoms`, `deciding_rule`, `rejected_facts`, `stalled_stage`). INVARIANT: for `indeterminate`
    and `unavailable` the `permitted` flag stays false, `proof_checked` stays false, and `decision`
