    features), each with its fitted contribution, band, and reliability. forecast = baseline

    verified=true the active-driver set is run through the verified kernel — each driver is stamped

    a platform: a prediction config exists on the platform whose target_field is present and numeric in
    at least one ready/ingested dataset. No training and no minimum row count is required — when too few
    rows or too weak a signal yield no driver-rules, the response is an HONEST forecast: with the
    default baseline_mode=neural the value is the GBT prediction through the S2 confidence gate
    (forecast_tier=neural_scored when confident, neural_weak when below threshold, with
    neural_confidence_tau emitted separately — the raw GBT prediction is always served, never replaced;
    no_forecast only when no model exists); with other anchors it is the baseline anchor
    (forecast_tier=baseline_anchor; point_is_persistence==true ONLY when baseline_mode is persistence).
    WITH a real RMSE-based interval, not an error. Unmet preconditions return a STRUCTURED error (409
    when the target is absent from every dataset; 422 when the latest row's target is non-numeric),
    never a raw 404.
