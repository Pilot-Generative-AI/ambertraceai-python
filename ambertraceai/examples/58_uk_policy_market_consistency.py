"""58 — UK policy-market consistency (proof-carrying equilibrium / disequilibrium calls).

A macro market is in a *consistency equilibrium* when the prices it is quoting can all be true
at once. Disequilibrium is when they cannot — the market is pricing a combination that a policy
reaction function cannot reconcile, so something has to give. That dislocation *is* the trade.

This demo reduces the classic Bank-of-England-vs-market tension to two signed residuals and lets
the platform certify which state the UK rates market is in, on real monthly history (2009-2026).
The two inputs are computed *outside* AmberTrace (the numerical "search" — a market-implied OIS
path, a Taylor-type reaction prescription, a breakeven curve). AmberTrace's job is the verified
verdict:

  * ``path_reaction_gap``   — the 2Y SONIA-OIS spot rate (the market-implied average Bank Rate
    path over two years) minus the rate a BoE reaction function prescribes given UK inflation and
    unemployment. At or above zero, the market prices a *tighter* path than the reaction function
    warrants; below zero, an *easier* path (e.g. slower/fewer hikes than the data supports).
  * ``inflation_anchor_gap`` — the 10Y breakeven (RPI, re-based to CPI by a fixed wedge) minus
    the 2% CPI target. At or above zero, inflation is priced *hot* (at/above anchor); below zero,
    *soft*.

Four mutually-exclusive, exhaustive states (a symmetric N-class verdict — no state is a silent
"everything else" default, so a disequilibrium can never slip through as a missing case):

    path >=0, infl >=0  -> COHERENT_HAWKISH    (equilibrium: tight path, hot inflation)
    path  <0, infl  <0  -> COHERENT_DOVISH     (equilibrium: easy path, cooling inflation)
    path  <0, infl >=0  -> DISLOCATED_DOVISH   (disequilibrium: easy path, sticky inflation)
    path >=0, infl  <0  -> DISLOCATED_HAWKISH  (disequilibrium: tight path, cooling inflation)

The two DISLOCATED cells are certified *disequilibria*. Each answer names the symbolic rules that
fired and ships a machine-checked proof (``proof_checked``): the proof chain is the two colliding
conditions written out — the thesis you would hand to a risk committee ("we fade the priced easing
because the breakeven says inflation is still hot and the reaction function does not warrant it").

WHICH API — read this first. This is NOT ``author()``. The symmetric N-class consistency
classifier is a SEPARATE verified platform whose DECISION VERBS *are* the class labels. Build it
through the ordinary ``domains`` -> ``build_ontology`` -> ``platforms`` surface (same as ex38).
Query with ``platforms.query(... facts={...})`` and read ``decision`` / ``proof_checked``.

DATA: every input is a real market/economic observation (BoE OIS archive, BoE breakevens, ONS CPI,
UK unemployment). Bundled snapshot: ``data/uk_policy_consistency_panel.csv`` (206 monthly rows,
two feature columns). No API key beyond AmberTrace is needed.

    "overnight index swaps) minus the path a Bank of England reaction function prescribes given "
    "inflation and unemployment — at or above zero when the market prices a tighter path than the "
    "reaction function warrants, below zero when it prices an easier path (for example a slower "
    "or shallower hiking path than the data supports). inflation_anchor_gap is priced breakeven "
    "inflation minus the 2 percent target — at or above zero when inflation is priced hot (at or "
    "above anchor), below zero when it is priced soft. When path_reaction_gap is at or above zero "
    "and inflation_anchor_gap is at or above zero, the state is COHERENT_HAWKISH: a tight priced "
    "path leaning against hot inflation is mutually consistent, an equilibrium. When "
    "path_reaction_gap is below zero and inflation_anchor_gap is below zero, the state is "
    "COHERENT_DOVISH: an easy priced path into cooling inflation is mutually consistent, an "
    "equilibrium. When path_reaction_gap is below zero and inflation_anchor_gap is at or above "
    "zero, the state is DISLOCATED_DOVISH: the market prices an easier path than warranted while "
    "inflation is still hot, which the reaction function cannot reconcile, a disequilibrium. When "
    "path_reaction_gap is at or above zero and inflation_anchor_gap is below zero, the state is "
    "DISLOCATED_HAWKISH: the market prices a tighter path than warranted while inflation is "
